## HOW TO INSTALL AND USE CODEHOP?
**>CodeHop was written in C++, It reads a file that is called "CodeHopFile.txt" and interprets it. You will have to write your code in this file and launch CodeHop.exe. If the interpreter is not working, make sure that CodeHopFile.txt is in the codehop folder!**

## WILL CODEHOP BE UPGRADED?
**>Of course, codehop will be upgraded with new versions. For now, the actual version is 1.0**
